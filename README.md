Although the data in this table is eliminated the ride share data for new years. But I think that the data here should be higher in all areas for the New Years data collected. 
## Summary
In summary there are more rides and drivers in the Urban areas which causes for the total fare amounts to be higher. But with that being said the average far of the ride is lower and and average fare of the driver. This is because urban cities are more congested and rides are usually shorter distances but a lot of people in urban areas do not have cars. The reason why rural area fares are so expensive is because riders need to longer distances because everything in these areas are spread apart. Suburban areas are the median in all columns because the city's population is mixed.
